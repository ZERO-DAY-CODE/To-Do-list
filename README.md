# To - Do List
Features of the To-Do List
<b>Add Tasks:</b> Users can add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing Enter.
<b>Mark as Completed:</b> Click on a task to toggle its completion status (strikes through completed tasks).
<b>Delete Tasks:</b> Each task has a delete button to remove it.
<b>Persistent Storage:</b> Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist after page refresh.
<b>Responsive Design:</b> The layout is clean and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

The styling is minimal and modern, with a green "Add" button and red "Delete" buttons for clear visual feedback.
Tasks are stored in localStorage, so they remain until the browser cache is cleared.
The JavaScript includes basic error handling (e.g., preventing empty tasks).
If you'd like additional features (e.g., task categories, due dates, or filtering), let me know, and I can extend the code!
