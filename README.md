# To - Do List
Features of the To-Do List<br>
<b>Add Tasks:</b> Users can add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing Enter.<br>
<b>Mark as Completed:</b> Click on a task to toggle its completion status (strikes through completed tasks).<br>
<b>Delete Tasks:</b> Each task has a delete button to remove it.<br>
<b>Persistent Storage:</b> Tasks are saved in the browser's <b>localStorage<b>, so they persist after page refresh.<br>
<b>Responsive Design:</b> The layout is clean and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>

<b>Note : - </b>
The styling is minimal and modern, with a green "Add" button and red "Delete" buttons for clear visual feedback.<br>
Tasks are stored in localStorage, so they remain until the browser cache is cleared.<br>
The JavaScript includes basic error handling (e.g., preventing empty tasks).<br>
If you'd like additional features (e.g., task categories, due dates, or filtering), let me know, and I can extend the code!<br>
